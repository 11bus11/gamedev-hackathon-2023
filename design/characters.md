## Max Quantum

The player character. The Temporal Agency's most dilligent Janitor. With the time agents swamped fighting off the hordes of Anachronauts, Max is left alone with his all access keys and the Temporal Agency's armoury. Trading his mop for a Paradox Gauntlet, Max is all that is left to foil Dr Chronosus's evil plans. It's time to clean up this time-line.

* Long range attack (sending the enemy back to its own time with paradox gauntlet). Large jump. Time paradox (start it by pressing E and it will "record" what you do. Thenm it will send you back and you can do something else while your ghost goes thru the "recording").

## Dr Chronosus

Dr. Chronosus, the wicked mastermind behind the temporal chaos, is a malevolent genius driven by a sinister desire to reshape history. With his Chronomatic Resonator, he shattered the temporal continuum into shards, causing eras to collide and mingle. Harnessing the power of time manipulation, Dr. Chronosus assembles an army of Anachronauts, twisted soldiers plucked from different epochs, to enforce his nefarious plans. This diabolical antagonist seeks to rewrite the fabric of time itself, plunging the world into eternal chaos and domination.

## Anachronauts

Dr Chronosus's army, recruited from the worst armies of history.
* Mummies - meele attack only. No jumping
* Nazis - meele and long range (gun) attack (reload time exists). Small jump.
* Viking - Meele attack (double damage). Small jump.
