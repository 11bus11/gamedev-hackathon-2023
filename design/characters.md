## Max Quantum

The player character. The Temporal Agency's most dilligent Janitor. With the time agents swamped fighting off the hordes of Anachronauts, Max is left alone with his all access keys and the Temporal Agency's armoury. Trading his mop for a Paradox Gauntlet, Max is all that is left to foil Dr Chronosus's evil plans. It's time to clean up this time-line.

## Dr Chronosus

Dr. Chronosus, the wicked mastermind behind the temporal chaos, is a malevolent genius driven by a sinister desire to reshape history. With his Chronomatic Resonator, he shattered the temporal continuum into shards, causing eras to collide and mingle.

This diabolical antagonist seeks to rewrite the fabric of time itself, plunging the world into eternal chaos and domination.
